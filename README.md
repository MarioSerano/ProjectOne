# My First Project!
So I Want to Create an About-Me, Blog-Like page<br>
I want to show my passion for coding, but also show my passion for writing things and creating contents in general<br>
Also I want to show them what I like, for example reading, talking, etc.<br>
Also my SWOT Analysis for myself<br>
My Achievements<br>
And my personal life, really!<br>

Narrowing it down:
1. Blog Section
2. Section where I can explain my skillsets
3. Programming languages and what I've done!

But I want this to be as good as possible, the best about-me and blog ever!
