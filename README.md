# My First Project!
So I Want to Create an About-Me, Blog-Like page<br>
I want to show my passion for coding, but also show my passion for: 
- Writing things and creating contents in general.
- Also I want to show them what I like, for example reading, talking, etc.
- Also my SWOT Analysis for myself.
- My Achievements.
- And my personal life, really!.

Narrowing it down:
1. Blog Section
2. Section where I can explain my skillsets
3. Programming languages and what I've done!

But I want this to be as good as possible, the best about-me and blog ever!

# Languages planning to be used
I plan on using few languages in mind, also few ideas that I want to implement.<br>
I want to implement:
- CRUD.
- ??.

Languages I want to use are the languages/frameworks that I've been learning, as follows:
- Gatsby/React/GraphQL for frontend development,
- Django for backend development.

# Future Plans
I currently plan on being a full Javascript stack for at least this year and the year after, thinking probably going to learn functional programming since it's my idol's programming language(lol)<br>
So yeah on other projects I plan to use(also) few other Javascript stacks, planning to get into MERN stack ASAP so I'll be job ready! :) <br>

# Disclaimer
This Readme-MD specifically most likely on my personal projects will be my blog also, since I want to write down my thought process facing projects, and also show how far I've become, but most importantly for other people to be motivated and encouraged to just make your own personal projects as your own diary!

# Timeline
Most likely I'll be doing this project after midterm, going to do this for at least a month.<br>
Sorry if this doesnt update though, since I have few things to study as well, such as:
- Flutter(for Hackathon competition), and
- Data Structures & Algorithm(for internship, unlikely though).
I'll update this ASAP if I have the time!

# LET'S CODE!
