## So I Want to Create an About-Me, Blog-Like page
## I want to show my passion for coding, but also show my passion for writing things and creating contents in general
## Also I want to show them what I like, for example reading, talking, etc.
## Also my SWOT Analysis for myself
## My Achievements
## And my personal life, really!

## Narrowing it down:
## 1. Blog Section
## 2. Section where I can explain my skillsets
## 3. Programming languages and what I've done!

## But I want this to be as good as possible, the best about-me and blog ever!"
